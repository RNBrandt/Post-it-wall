# REACT.JS Post-it-wall

This Project has been created to desmonstrate my capabilites with React.JS.  It is a complete front-end with realistic-looking post-it-notes. 

Additional work which could be done includes: 

Changing colors of the notes

Ensuring the notes don't overlap

Integrate with a to-do-list API
